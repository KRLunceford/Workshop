          <h2>About Long's Peak</h2>
          <p class="desc">
			Longs Peak, which dominates the horizon throughout northern Colorado, is
      Rocky Mountain National Park's most famous landmark. The peak tops out at
      14,259 feet above sea level, making it the northernmost 14,000 foot peak in
      the American Rockies. Thousands of hikers attempt to reach its lofty summit
      each summer via the Keyhole Route, while many climbers venture to the
      world-famous East Face and its many climbing routes.<br>

			14,259 feet above sea level!<br>

			Breathtaking Views!<br>


			One-way distance: 7.5 miles from Longs Peak Trailhead to the summit
      Starting elevation: 9400 feet - Summit elevation 14,259 feet - Net change 4,859 feet<br>

			The Keyhole Route is the only approach that offers a non-technical route to the summit of
      Longs Peak, but the route has dangerous ice and snow levels throughout most or all of the
      year. Therefore, the Keyhole Route generally remains technical except for a small time
      window each summer, as detailed by the following statement from the National Park Service:<br><br>

			"Every year, from approximately Sept. 15 to July 15, the upper part of Longs Peak
      accumulates significant snow and ice. When this occurs, the Keyhole Route becomes
      a technical climb requiring crampons, ice axe, helmet, and most of all -mountaineering
      experience- in order to complete the ascent safely. The peak is not closed. Technical
      merely demotes a change in conditions which should be regarded accordingly by
      mountaineers, hikers, and climbers. Failure to heed this warning has resulted in injury
      and death for some hikers and climbers."<br>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Longs Peak has captivated onlookers for centuries, and its fame as a hiking destination began in the 1860's. The first documented climb was by a team led by John Wesley Powell in 1868, although evidence proves Native Americans had been climbing the peak for some time prior to that date. Since Powell's first climb, numerous new routes were established, including the popular Keyhole and North Face routes, and many technical climbing routes on the imposing and challenging East Face.

              <h2>Getting There</h2>
              <p>
                The Longs Peak Trailhead is located off of Colorado Highway 7, about 9 miles south of Estes Park and 2 miles north of the village of Meeker Park. Look for the large brown sign pointing to the "Longs Peak Area" off of Highway 7, and turn west here on to a paved road. Follow the road west just over a mile to the parking area at the Longs Peak Trailhead, a left-hand turn where the road splits at the campground entrance. This parking area fills quickly in the summer, and even arriving early in the morning may not guarantee a spot in the parking lot. Roadside parking, although restricted to certain areas, is available north and east of the trailhead for overflow traffic. There is currently no fee charged for access to the Longs Peak Trailhead or parking. The parking area is not available for overnight parking, except for backcountry hikers who have reservations at sites along the trail.</p>

		       <h2>Weather</h2>
		       <p>			
            At 14,259 feet, Longs Peak towers above all other summits in Rocky Mountain National Park. The flat-topped monarch is seen from almost anywhere in the park. Different angles show the great mountain's unique profiles. Changing weather reflects Longs Peak's many moods.<br>




            In the summertime, when conditions allow, thousands climb to Longs' summit via the Keyhole Route. The Keyhole Route is not a hike. It is a climb that crosses enormous sheer vertical rock faces, often with falling rocks, requiring scrambling, where an unroped fall would likely be fatal. The route has narrow ledges, loose rock, and steep cliffs.<br>


            For most of the year, climbing Longs Peak is in winter conditions, which requires winter mountaineering experience and the knowledge and use of specialized equipment. Disregard for the mountain environment any time of year has meant danger, injury and even death.<br>


						The Keyhole Route can experience winter-like conditions at any time, requiring greater skill and judgment. Be prepared to turn back during sudden, drastic weather changes.
			<br>

						The high elevation may affect your condition and judgment. Careful descent is the best treatment.
			<br>

						Don't have summit fever: Enjoy the experience, but be willing to turn around at any time.
			<br>

		       <h2>Keyhole Trail</h2>
              <p>
				The trailhead is west of Colorado 7 and can be reached from the north or the south. For the northern approach, drive 9.2 miles south from the intersection of US 36 and CO 7 to the turnoff for the Ranger Station. For the southern approach, drive north 10 miles from the junction of CO 7 and CO 72 on the Peak to Peak Highway to the Ranger Station turnoff. From the turnoff drive west 1 mile to the trailhead. Note: Car-camping is not allowed in the parking area. There is a tent campground nearby and a couple of full campgrounds near Meeker Park. <br>

       Turn right and traverse west and northwest across the northeast slope of Mt. Lady Washington - Photo #2 Hike all the way to Granite Pass to reach another trail junction. The North Longs Peak Trail heads off to the right. Stay left on the East Longs Peak Trail and switchback up and easy slope to reach the north end of the Boulder Field, near 12,400‘. The north and east faces of Longs come into view, as well as Storm Peak (13,326‘) ahead. Follow the trail south into the Boulder Field (Photo #4) and past some established tent sites in the middle of the field. There is a restroom in this area. Your next goal is to reach the Keyhole - a notch in the rugged ridge between Longs Peak and Storm Peak. The trail finally runs out near 12,800‘ on the south end of the Boulder Field but follow cairns up through the rocks to reach the Keyhole.<br>

       Pass through the Keyhole to the west side of the ridge where the remaining route becomes more difficult and requires a slower pace. Glacier Gorge is down to the right and the next section of the route is to the left. Scramble south along ledges by following painted bull‘s-eyes which mark the remaining route to the summit. Approximately 1/3 of the way across the ledges, the route climbs up about 50‘ before descending 100‘. This up and down adds a bit of complexity to this section. Photo #8 and Photo #9 show some of the terrain. <br><br>
       Near 13,300’, enter The Trough, a defined gully which climbs 600’ up the east side of Longs - Photo #10. The route is still well marked but it can take a bit of searching to find the route markers but, generally, ascend the center of the Trough. Some easy scrambling is required in several areas. The rock is mostly stable but there are a few sections of small, loose rock. Taken near 13,700’, Photo #11 looks down the Trough and climbers can be seen in the center. Near the top of the Trough, climb 30‘ of steeper rock (Photo #12) to reach the top of the Trough at a small, flat area. You‘re now on the upper portion of the ridge which connects Longs to Pagoda Mountain (13,497‘). <br>

       Next, you must cross The Narrows - an exposed ledge which crosses the south side of Longs. Carefully climb around a couple of badly positioned rocks (Photo #13) and continue across the Narrows - Photo #14, Photo #15 and Photo #16. After crossing the Narrows, scramble up onto more difficult rock to see the remaining route to the summit - Photo #17. The final pitch is called the Homestretch. It looks worse than it is, although water or ice will make it much more difficult. Climb through a couple more sections of rock to reach the final portion of the Homestretch - Photo #18. This pitch is straightforward - follow the cracks toward the summit. Climb about 300‘ up the Homestretch to reach the large, flat summit. <br>
       This is a long climb with plenty of scrambling on the last mile. In summer, start very early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. Also, dogs are not allowed on this route. <br>
